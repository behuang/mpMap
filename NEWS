Version 1.25:
-------------------------
* Functions mpcollapse and mpexpand added for dealing with bins of markers
* mpimpute function renamed to mpimputerf
* low-coverage genotyping-by-sequencing imputation implemented as mpimpute function
* plotGTK functions moved off into separate stand-alone package mpMapInteractive


Version 1.20:
-------------------------
* plotGTK function has been added for interactive map construction
* computemap function has been revised to better estimate map positions
* mpimpute replaces fill/fill2 functions to impute missing recombination fractions
* recombination fraction has been reimplemented using Rcpp and will parallelize easily

Version 1.12:
-------------------------
* Functions for interval mapping have been consolidated (mpIMmm, mpIMlm) with
	argument to determine whether mixed models are used or not (mpIM)

* Plot of QTL mapping results shows support intervals for all QTL (plot.mpqtl)
	function to compute support intervals for QTL (supportinterval)
	- useful for determining precision of QTL positioning

* Function to compute map positions given a map order (based on recombination
	fractions between adjacent markers) (computemap)

* Function to reorder all components of an mpcross object given a map order (maporder)

* Function to fill in missing values based on multipoint haplotype probabilities(fillmiss)

* Functions to fill in missing recombination fractions based on nearby markers (fill/fill2)

* mapcomp structure to compare orders across two maps. Summary provides 
	information on how many markers are in each map and in common as well
	as correlations between maps. Plot displays marker positions from each
	map against each other for all chromosomes with > 1 marker in common. 
	Points along the diagonal indicate exact agreement between maps. 

* Altered mp.sim to generate 0/1 genotypes for founders either in accordance
	with recombination fractions or with founders in linkage equilibrium

* mp.sim has been renamed to sim.mpcross

* Function to pull out markers surrounding qtl (qtlmap) and plot linkage map (plotlink.map) with QTL highlighted
